In the attempt to make an Intelligent Computer Player, I used the method
that flipped the board pieces and instead of using the "if" statement to 
set the 2D board array information I used it to count the number of pieces 
being flipped. Once I did that I iterated through the alternate and partially 
empty 2D array that contained possible moves to see which move had the most
pieces to flip. Running short on time I feel that it is about 90 percent
correct.
